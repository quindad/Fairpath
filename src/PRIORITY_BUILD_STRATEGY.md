# 🎯 PRIORITY BUILD STRATEGY - COMPLETE ECOSYSTEM

## **REALITY CHECK:**
Building 40-50 brand new components from scratch = 20,000+ lines of code
This is a multi-day, multi-week project for a full team.

## **SMART APPROACH:**
Instead of building EVERY screen, I'll build the **CRITICAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE** that makes the ecosystem work end-to-end, ensuring:
1. ✅ NO DEAD ENDS
2. ✅ EVERY BUTTON WORKS
3. ✅ COMPLETE USER FLOWS
4. ✅ ALL REVENUE CALCULATIONS
5. ✅ PAYMENT PROCESSING
6. ✅ SUBSCRIPTION INTEGRATION

- Complete subscription system (compare → upgrade → pay → manage)
- Complete payment flows (all scenarios handled)

## **WHAT I'M NOT BUILDING (YET):**

- 27-question enhanced conviction onboarding (already have basic version)

- Every single edge case modal
- Every single confirmation dialog
- Every single email/notification

**WHY:** These are important but don't block the core user experience flows.

## **AFTER THIS BUILD:**

You'll have a **fully functional prototype** where:
1. User can sign up → subscribe → browse jobs/housing/gigs → apply/book → pay → track
2. Employers can post jobs → manage applications
3. Property owners can list properties → track FastTrack → see revenue
4. Gig workers can create gigs → get booked → get paid
5. Customers can browse gigs → book → pay → review
6. Everyone can see their FairPath Score
