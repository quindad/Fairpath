## 🎯 THE PITCH (Built Into Website)

**The Problem:**
- 600,000 people released from prison every year

**Why Current System Fails:**
- Incarceration costs $35K/person/year
- Kids of incarcerated parents are 3x more likely to face incarceration
- The cycle continues without intervention

**Our Solution:**

2. **Reentry Simulation** - Educational tool to build empathy
3. **Employer/Property Solutions** - Make it easy to give second chances

- Donate (any currency)
- Partner with us
