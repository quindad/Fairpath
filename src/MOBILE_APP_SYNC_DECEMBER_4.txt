                    QUESTIONS FOR MOBILE TEAM
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. Do you want to build FairPath Legal in the mobile app or web-only?
2. Should we share a single backend for lawyer profiles and leads?
3. How do you want to handle the AI eligibility API? (shared endpoint?)
4. Mobile app doing Stripe subscriptions for lawyers or web-only?
5. Messaging system - in-app or redirect to web?
6. Timeline for FairPath Legal mobile implementation?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                    BACKEND TODO (For Both Teams)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Need to build:
1. AI Eligibility API
   - Input: charges, probation status, pending charges
   - Output: eligibility result object (see data model above)
   - Should check real state laws (we're mocking for now)

2. Lawyer Authentication
   - Separate from user auth
   - Lawyer signup → create profile → activate subscription
   - Stripe webhook for subscription status

3. Lawyer Profile CRUD
   - Create, read, update, delete lawyer profiles
   - Public endpoint for directory (filtered by state)
   - Protected endpoint for lawyer to update own profile

4. Lead Management
   - User submits eligibility → if eligible → create lead for matched lawyers
   - Lawyer can view/update lead status
   - Notification system (email/push when new lead)

5. Messaging System
   - Real-time chat between lawyer and client
   - Attach eligibility report to conversation
   - Read receipts, timestamps

6. Reviews/Ratings
   - Users can review lawyers after case closes
   - Aggregate rating (average of all reviews)
   - Display on lawyer profile
