PLATFORM:      $30.00 (40% gross - unchanged)
  - SingleKey: -$17.99 to -$21.99

## 🎯 REAL-WORLD MONTHLY REVENUE EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Small Landlord Portfolio (Tier 2)
```
Monthly FastTrack Applications: 100
SingleKey Volume Tier: 100 reports @ $21.99/each
Landlord Rental Success: 5 rentals out of 100 (5%)

REVENUE BREAKDOWN:
Total Application Fees: 100 × $75 = $7,500

Landlords Earn:
  → 100 apps × $45 = $4,500 (assuming all rent within limits)

Platform Gross:
  → 100 apps × $30 = $3,000

Platform Costs:
  → 100 reports × $21.99 = $2,199

Platform NET:
  → $3,000 - $2,199 = $801/month

Impact Fund (if some landlords don't rent):
  → Varies based on landlord performance
```

---

### Example 2: Medium Market (Tier 3)
```
Monthly FastTrack Applications: 300
SingleKey Volume Tier: 200-499 reports @ $19.99/each
Landlord Rental Success: 15 rentals (5%)

REVENUE BREAKDOWN:
Total Application Fees: 300 × $75 = $22,500

Landlords Earn:
  → 300 apps × $45 = $13,500

Platform Gross:
  → 300 apps × $30 = $9,000

Platform Costs:
  → 300 reports × $19.99 = $5,997

Platform NET:
  → $9,000 - $5,997 = $3,003/month
  → $1,001/month vs Tier 2! (+125% profit increase)

Impact Fund:
  → Varies by performance
```

---

### Example 3: Enterprise Scale (Tier 4)
```
Monthly FastTrack Applications: 1,000
SingleKey Volume Tier: 500+ reports @ $17.99/each
Landlord Rental Success: 50 rentals (5%)

REVENUE BREAKDOWN:
Total Application Fees: 1,000 × $75 = $75,000

Landlords Earn:
  → 1,000 apps × $45 = $45,000

Platform Gross:
  → 1,000 apps × $30 = $30,000

Platform Costs:
  → 1,000 reports × $17.99 = $17,990

Platform NET:
  → $30,000 - $17,990 = $12,010/month
  → 40% profit margin! 🚀

Impact Fund:
  → Depends on landlord accountability
```

**AT ENTERPRISE SCALE:**
- Platform earns $12.01 per application vs $8.01 at startup
- That's **50% more profit** per application!
- Volume discounts from SingleKey directly improve margins

## 🏆 BREAKEVEN ANALYSIS

### Cost to Operate (Per Application):
```
SingleKey Report:           $17.99 - $21.99
Platform/Server Costs:      ~$2.00 (estimate)
Payment Processing (2.9%):  ~$2.18 (on $75)
Support/Operations:         ~$1.00 (estimate)
-------------------------------------------
Total Platform Cost:        $23.17 - $27.17

Platform Receives:          $30.00
Platform NET Profit:        $2.83 - $6.83 per application

## 📱 LANDLORD ACCOUNTABILITY TRACKING

### Countdown System:

**When landlord receives their FIRST FastTrack application:**
```
Start Tracking:
  1. Application Counter: 0/20
  2. Day Counter: 0/60
  3. Revenue Rate: 60% ($45/app)
```

**If landlord RENTS to a felon before hitting limits:**
```
✅ REWARD:
  → Countdown RESETS
  → Next 20 apps at 60% rate ($45)
  → Maintain "Felon-Friendly" badge
  → Priority search placement
```

**If landlord hits 20 apps OR 60 days WITHOUT renting:**
```
❌ PENALTY:
  → Revenue rate drops to 36% ($27/app)
  → 24% ($18/app) goes to Impact Fund
  → Lower search ranking
  → Countdown continues until they rent

Once they rent:
  → Countdown resets
  → Revenue returns to 60% ($45)
```
